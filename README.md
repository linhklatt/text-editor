# text-editor

## Description

This is a text editor application that can be easily installed onto a web browser without requiring an internet connection. It uses an IndexedDB database, which is stored locally in the browser, and allows for offline editing. To begin using the application, the user must enter three command lines: "npm install", "npm run build", and "npm start". Once the application has been launched, it can be accessed by navigating to http://localhost:3000. The user can then click on the install button, which will trigger a pop-up message prompting them to install the application.
